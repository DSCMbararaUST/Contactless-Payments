# Contactless-Payments
Contactless Payments is a mobile app with the implementation of the NFC hardware feature to implement contactless payments with the use of different payment APIs available for example the MTN MoMo and Flutterwave.  This will then eliminate the need to dial USSD codes to initiate a payment at different sale points and devices that are available at different establishments and business.
